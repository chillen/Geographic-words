# Client

The client interface is forked from my Procedural Points of Interest.

Different locations can have a field associated with them at different
intensities and this is displayed on the right side. Additionally, there
are a few different map views. These were screenshots from maps
generated at RedBlobGames, because he's an awesome person with great work.
